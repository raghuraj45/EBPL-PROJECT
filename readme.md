# EBPL-DS â€“ Cracking the Market Code

This project demonstrates AI-driven stock price prediction using LSTM neural networks with time series data. It downloads historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance and trains a deep learning model to predict closing prices.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)
- Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
- Matplotlib for plotting

## How to Run:

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the script:
   python stock_predictor.py

3. Enter any stock ticker when prompted (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
